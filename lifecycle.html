LIFE CYCLE OF COMPONENTS

1. Constructor(props)
2. componentDidMount()
3. componentDidUpdate(props,prevstate) in this we first compare the state and props then we will fetch the data
4. render()
5. componentWillUnmount() it will vanish the present data of the page like when you want to go to the about page then your home page data has been vanished properly if you did it in this state

first of all constructor run then render and then componentDidMount
we don't need to import anything for componentDidMount
componentDidMount run when every html and states are run properly then turns come of componentDidMount
we should call API in componentDidMount


after click then first render run and then componentDidUpdate will run but it has only previous state value


==============================================
REDUX:

Redux is just a better way to manage the data
Redux is predictable state container for javascript app(store the state of container)

import createStore from redux;
import {Provider} from 'react-redux'  it is use to rap the whole component

function movieReducer(state,action){  in the state section we add all the data or intial state of data
	return state   //return state always  and reducer is pure function
}

const store = createStore(movieReducer);  we must need reducer in the createStore function 

<Provider store={store}> pass store as a property of provider
	<Home>
</Provider>



which page i have to connect with the redux then we use below methods
import {Connect} from 'react-redux';
export default connect()(Home)   in the connect second agrument as const function and in the first argument we send state and dispatch action 


then use dispatch the action
in the dispatch we have type and payload



================================
PROMISE:
 A promise is an object that my produce a single value some time in future either a resolved value or a reason that it's not resolved(rejected)
states of promise
*Fullfiled
*Rejected
*Pending

we had call backs before promises

.catch caught any type of error in promise
catch only run if something fails
Promise.all takes array of promises

example of call backs:
-------------------------------------
movePlayer(100,'left',function(){
	movePlayer(400,'right',function(){
	});
});




example of promise:
----------------------------------------------
const promise = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
	if(true){
		resolve("stuff worked");
	}else{
		reject("Error,it broke");
	}
})

const promise2 = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
	setTimeout(resolve,100,'Hiii')
})

const promise3 = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
	setTimeout(resolve,1000,'Pookie')
})

const promise4 = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
	setTimeout(resolve,3000,'Is it me  you are looking for?')
})

Promise.all([promise,promise2,promise3,promise4])
.then(value => {
	console.log(value);
})


promise
.then(result => result + '!')
.then(result2 => {
	throw Error
	console.log(result2)
})
.catch(() => console.log('error!'))


promise
.then(result => result + '!')
.then(result2 => result2 + '?')
.catch(() => console.log('error!'))
.then(result3 => {
	console.log( result3 + '!');
})

-----------------------------------------
REAL TIME EXAMPLE OF PROMISES

const urls = [
	'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts',
	'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users',
	'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums'
]
Promise.all(urls.map(url => {
	return fetch(url).then(response => response.json())
})).then(results => {
	console.log(results[0])
	console.log(results[1])
	console.log(results[2])
}).catch(() => console.log('error'))
================================================================
ES8 OR Async

asyc function playGame()
awiat
in the async there is no at all any function .catch that's why we use try catch error handling

example:
----------------------------------

async function fetchUsers(){
	const response = await fetch('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
	const data = await response.json();
	console.log(data);
}
----------------------------------
const urls = [
	'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts',
	'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users',
	'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums'
]

const getData = async function(){
	const [users,posts,albums] = await Promise.all(urls.map(url =>
	 fetch(url).then(response => response.json())
	))
	console.log('users',users)
	console.log('posts',posts)
	console.log('albums',albums)
}

-----------------------------------
ES9(Object Spread operator)
finally: it will be always call either promise reject or resolved at the most time we used it at the end of code,we use as notification or alert

const animals ={
	tigers:23,
	monkey:10,
	lion:1,
}
const {tigers, ...rest} = animals;

const array = [1,2,3,4,5];
function sum(a,b,c,d,e){
	return a+b+c+d+e;
}
sum(...array);
------------------------------------------
Parallel: run all promise at the same time by using Promise.all(array); faster then sequence but slower then race
sequence:run all promises by sequence using async await and sequence().then(); it is slowest method
race : run who appear first by using Promise.race(array); it is faster then any other method because he has to run only first request

==========================================
in the class component render function is must

for example:
-------------
class App extends React.components{
	render(){
		return(
		)
	}
}


secureTextEntry
maxLength
keyboardType 
onChangeText={(text)} => {this.setstate({name:text})}
onBlur={()=> this.emailvalidation}



import React, {Component} from 'react';
import  {Router,Stack,Scene} from 'react-native-router-flux';
import Login from '../src/pages/login';
import Signup from '../src/pages/Signup';

class Routers extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return(
            <Router hideNavBar={true}>
                <Stack key='root'>
                    <Scene key="login" Component={Login} title="Login"/>
                    <Scene key="register" Component={Signup} title="Register"/>
                    <Scene key="home" Component={Home}/>
                </Stack>
            </Router>
        )
    }
}
==========================
JSON.stringify(obj)  is used to change the obj into string because you have to send the data into the server in string format

JSON.prase(obj)  is used for converting string into object


AsyncStorage.setItem('user',JSON.stringify(obj));

dispay = async() => {
	let user = await AsyncStorage.getItem('user');
	let prased = JSON.prase(user);
	alert(prased.name);
}

=========================================
Pure Components in React

Prevents re-rendering of Component if props or state is the same
Takes care of “shouldComponentUpdate” implicitly
State and Props are Shallow Compared
Pure Components are more performant in certain cases


React Components re-renders in the following scenarios:
“setState” is called in Component
“props” values are updated
this.forceUpdate() is called




DIFF BW STATE AND PROPS:

Previously I have mentioned that ‘props’ are set by the parent component and they are passed to a child component. The child component can’t change the values in ‘props’. For handling any changeable data we need to use a different component property called ‘state’.

A ‘state’ is used to store data that may change in a component. Each component has a different ‘state’ values. Based on these values, the UI is changed.

One more important thing is that we can’t change any value in a state directly. For that, we need to call one method called ‘setState’. This method modifies the current state and re-render the whole component.
======================
FLATLIST:

it has two attributes i.e data and renderItem in the data attr we have to send all the data and in renderItem attribute we have data + item and index of elements  if we write item in between {} then we have direct data without index e.g:item.name


without key initialization if we want to delete the particular element but it will delete all the items 
key must be string and unique if we pass static
we juse keyExtractor{(friend) => friend.name}
if we add horizontal attr in flat list then we can scroll through the horizontal rather then vertically
showHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}
=================================
advantages of touchablity over button we can use it over images and some big pictuers rather then button

props => {image,title,whta}
render = give, provide 

========================
in the navigator we dont need to declare view element 
------------------------------
The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.

var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function.


--------------------------------
let can be updated but not re-declared.
const cannot be updated or re-declared
==================================



REDUCER: function that manages changes to an object

function that gets called with two objects
Argumnet1: object that has all of our state in it
Argumnet2: object that describes  the update we want to make it

1) we never change argument one directly
2) we must always return a value to be used as argument 1

hooks:
useState,useEffect and useReducer are the hooks
in the reducer we have to return state always
dispatch:run my reducer

in the action we have type and payload
type: tell us the exact change operation 
payload: critical change which we want
========================================


ALL ARE IN PARENT ELEMENT SUCH AS VIEW


alignItems:flex-end
alignItems:flex-start
alignItems:center


flexDertion:'column'
flexDertion:'row'
flexDertion:'row-reverse'
flexDertion:'column-revrse'


justifyContent:'flex-start'
justifyContent:'center'
justifyContent:'space-around'
justifyContent:'space-between'

=============================================
Context:


import createContext();
then make class like "BlogProvider" extends component and export it  OR we can make it with functional component also
but always export default which is  createContext() const like "BlogContext"
using class "BlogProvider" wrap all the component and always use children property"this.props.children"
use in the index page we have to import {useContext} in this we use  "BlogContext"
useContext = value which is given in provider


now we don't use navigation.getParam('id') fro getting ID it's replace by "route" 

header button to navigate from one screen to another
options={({ navigation, route }) => ({
            headerRight: props => <Button title="+" onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Create')}/>,
          })}


=============================
initialState:
----------------------------
const people = [
  {name: 'Jay', alive: true},
  {name: 'Kailee', alive: true},
  {name: 'John', alive: true},
  {name: 'Mia', alive: true}
]
---------------------------

const reducer = (people, action){
	
}


const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
==============================
A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic.Whereas a component transforms props into UI, a higher-order component transforms a component into another component.

const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);
